_Now:_  
**Deep diving into frontier technologies (LLMs, BCIs) to workout next project to start/join.**  
Hit me up if feels a mutual fit.

Intermittently I dabble into other creative avenues of personal interest:  
 -- [Write](https://blog.siteshshrivastava.com) when something to share  
 -- [Organize](https://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-adventure-group) adventure meetups around city  
 -- [Meet](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/siteshps) people with interesting life journey  
 -- [Podcast](https://anchor.fm/beyond-the-borders) with friends made across cultures  

_Last:_  
I co-founded and ran [Offbeat Capital](https://www.offbeat.capital), a delta-neutral quantitative crypto hedge fund which raised $10M+ across 25 investors, generated gross returns of 121% while trading 100+ instruments across 7 exchanges for a gross volume of $20B+ within timeframe of 20 months.

_Past:_  
Product ([Tiqets](https://tiqets.com)), Engineering ([Media.net](https://media.net), [Booking.com](https://booking.com)), Quant ([iRageCapital](http://iragecapital.com)), Startups (Nous, Browsed, Powow, Fallible)
